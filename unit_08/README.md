# Unit 8: Syntactic Analysis: Parsing

## Overview
This unit covers syntactic parsing techniques, from lightweight chunking to full grammar parsing, exploring how to analyze and represent the grammatical structure of text.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Understand different parsing approaches
