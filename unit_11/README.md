# Unit 11: Semantic Analysis - Document Clustering

## Overview
This unit covers document clustering techniques in Natural Language Processing, focusing on methods to automatically group similar documents together. The content includes both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

## Contents

### 1. K-Means Clustering (`01_kmeans_clustering.md`)
- Algorithm fundamentals
- Implementation details
- Advanced features
- Best practices
- Applications
- Limitations and considerations

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering (`02_hierarchical_clustering.md`)
- Types of hierarchical clustering
- Implementation details
- Distance metrics and linkage methods
- Advanced features
- Integration with other methods
- Best practices

### 3. Working with Clusters (`03_working_with_clusters.md`)
- Cluster analysis and interpretation
- Cluster refinement
- Practical applications
- Best practices
- Performance optimization

### 4. Exercises and Solutions
Located in the `exercises` directory:
- `document_clustering_exercises.md`: Comprehensive exercises
- `solutions/document_clustering_solutions.py`: Complete implementations
- Real-world applications
- Advanced techniques

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of:
  - Linear algebra
  - Basic statistics
  - Python programming
  - Text processing

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download required NLTK data:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

3. Install spaCy model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

### Running the Examples
Each markdown file contains executable Python code examples. To run them:

1. Extract the code into a `.py` file
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the script:
```bash
python example_script.py
```

### Working on Exercises
1. Navigate to the `exercises` directory
2. Start with `document_clustering_exercises.md`
3. Implement solutions in separate files
4. Check your solutions against provided examples
5. Run tests to verify implementations
