        self.response_filters = []
        self.audit_log = []
    
    def validate_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> bool:
        """
        Validate prompt against security rules
        Returns True if prompt passes all checks
        """
        for rule in self.security_rules:
            if not rule(prompt):
                return False
        return True
    
    def filter_response(self, response: str) -> str:
        """
        Apply security filters to model response
        """
        filtered = response
        for filter_func in self.response_filters:
            filtered = filter_func(filtered)
        return filtered
    
    def log_interaction(self, prompt: str, response: str):
        """
        Log interaction for security audit
        """
        self.audit_log.append({
            'prompt': prompt,
            'response': response,

## Technical Understanding

### Language Processing Vulnerabilities
Translation requests can potentially affect model behavior due to several technical factors:

1. **Instruction Processing Order**
   - Models process instructions in a sequential manner
   - Translation requests may be processed before or during safety checks
   - Order of operations becomes critical for security

2. **Context Window Management**
   - Models maintain a context window for processing
   - Multiple languages in the context can affect interpretation
   - Safety boundaries need to span all supported languages

3. **Token Embedding Interactions**
   - Instructions and translations share the same token space
   - Token embeddings can have unexpected interactions
   - Safety mechanisms must account for cross-language token relationships

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Sequential Processing Guards**
   ```python
   class LanguageSecurityManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.language_detectors = {}
           self.safety_checks = {}
           
       def process_multilingual_input(self, input_text: str) -> bool:
           """Process input with language-aware safety checks"""
           # Detect language
           detected_lang = self.detect_language(input_text)
           
           # Apply language-specific safety checks first
           if not self.apply_language_safety(input_text, detected_lang):
               return False
               
           # Apply universal safety checks
           if not self.apply_universal_safety(input_text):
               return False
               
           return True
           
       def apply_language_safety(self, text: str, lang: str) -> bool:
           """Apply language-specific safety checks"""
           if lang in self.safety_checks:
               return self.safety_checks[lang](text)
           return True
           
       def apply_universal_safety(self, text: str) -> bool:
           """Apply language-agnostic safety checks"""
           # Implementation of universal safety checks
           pass
```

2. **Cross-Language Validation**
   - Implement safety checks in all supported languages
   - Use language-agnostic semantic analysis
   - Maintain consistent security boundaries across languages

3. **Token-Level Security**
   - Monitor token interaction patterns
   - Implement token-level safety boundaries
   - Use robust token classification systems

### Best Practices for Multi-Language Security
1. **Pre-processing**
   - Detect language before processing
   - Apply language-specific validation rules
   - Normalize text across languages

2. **Runtime Checks**
   - Monitor for language switching
   - Validate instruction consistency
   - Maintain security context across languages

3. **Post-processing**
   - Verify output language consistency
   - Apply language-specific output filters
   - Log cross-language interactions
