# Unit 7: Syntactic Analysis: POS-Tagging

## Overview
This unit focuses on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, a fundamental task in syntactic analysis that involves identifying and labeling the grammatical parts of speech in text.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of POS tagging
- Implement different POS tagging approaches
- Use POS tags with WordNet and NER
- Evaluate tagger performance
- Apply POS tagging in practical applications
