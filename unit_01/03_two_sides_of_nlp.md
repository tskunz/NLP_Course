# The Two Sides of NLP

## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses two distinct but complementary aspects:
1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
2. Natural Language Generation (NLG)

Understanding these two sides is crucial for any practitioner in the field, as they represent fundamentally different approaches to working with human language.

## Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

### What is NLU?
- Processing and understanding input natural language
- Converting unstructured text into structured representations
- Extracting meaningful information from human-generated content

### Key Characteristics
- Input: Natural language (text, speech)
- Output: Structured representations or interpretations
- Focus: Making sense of human communication

### Example Applications
```python
from transformers import pipeline
import spacy

class TopicExtractor:
    """Example of NLU: Extracting main topics from essays"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        
    def extract_topics(self, essay: str, num_topics: int = 3):
        doc = self.nlp(essay)
        # Extract noun phrases as potential topics
        topics = [chunk.text for chunk in doc.noun_chunks]
        # Count frequency and get most common
        topic_freq = {}
        for topic in topics:
            topic_freq[topic] = topic_freq.get(topic, 0) + 1
            
        # Sort by frequency
        sorted_topics = sorted(topic_freq.items(), 
                             key=lambda x: x[1], 
                             reverse=True)
        
        return sorted_topics[:num_topics]

# Example usage
def demonstrate_nlu():
    extractor = TopicExtractor()
    essay = """
    Artificial intelligence has revolutionized modern technology.
    Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
    Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in various tasks.
    AI applications are transforming industries worldwide.
    """
    
    topics = extractor.extract_topics(essay)
    print("Main topics extracted:")
    for topic, freq in topics:
        print(f"- {topic} (mentioned {freq} times)")
```

### The Philosophy Question
- Does the machine truly "understand"?
- Historical context (Aristotle, Leibniz)
- Practical approach: Focus on useful representations
- Understanding lies in human interpretation

## Natural Language Generation (NLG)

### What is NLG?
- Creating natural language from structured data
- Converting information into human-readable text
- Generating coherent and contextually appropriate content

### Key Characteristics
- Input: Structured data or representations
- Output: Natural language text
- Focus: Producing human-like communication

### Example Applications
```python
class ProductDescriptionGenerator:
    """Example of NLG: Generating product descriptions"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.templates = {
            "price_comparison": "At ${price}, this {product} offers {feature} at a {value} price point.",
            "feature_highlight": "This {product} stands out with its {key_feature}, making it perfect for {use_case}.",
            "rating_summary": "With an average rating of {rating}/5 from {num_reviews} customers, this {product} is {sentiment}."
        }
    
    def generate_description(self, product_data: dict) -> str:
        """Generate natural language description from product data"""
        description_parts = []
        
        # Price comparison
        if "price" in product_data:
            price_text = self.templates["price_comparison"].format(
                price=product_data["price"],
                product=product_data["name"],
                feature=product_data.get("main_feature", "quality features"),
                value="competitive" if product_data["price"] < 100 else "premium"
            )
            description_parts.append(price_text)
        
        # Feature highlight
        if "features" in product_data:
            feature_text = self.templates["feature_highlight"].format(
                product=product_data["name"],
                key_feature=product_data["features"][0],
                use_case=product_data.get("primary_use", "everyday use")
            )
            description_parts.append(feature_text)
        
        return " ".join(description_parts)

# Example usage
def demonstrate_nlg():
    generator = ProductDescriptionGenerator()
    product_data = {
        "name": "SmartWatch Pro",
        "price": 89.99,
        "main_feature": "health tracking",
        "features": ["24/7 heart monitoring", "sleep tracking", "exercise detection"],
        "primary_use": "fitness enthusiasts"
    }
    
    description = generator.generate_description(product_data)
    print("Generated Description:")
    print(description)
```
