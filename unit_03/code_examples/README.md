# NLP Comparison Examples

This directory contains code examples demonstrating the differences between shallow and deep NLP approaches.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download the spaCy model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Files

- `nlp_comparison.py`: Demonstrates shallow vs deep NLP techniques for various tasks:
  - Named Entity Recognition
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Text Summarization
  - Question Answering
  - Syntactic Analysis

## Usage

```python
from nlp_comparison import ShallowNLP, DeepNLP, compare_approaches

# Sample text for analysis
text = """
Google has unveiled an innovative AI product that revolutionizes natural language processing. 
The new system, launched in March 2024, demonstrates remarkable capabilities in understanding 
context and generating human-like responses. Early testing shows a 40% improvement in 
accuracy compared to previous models.
"""

# Compare shallow and deep NLP approaches
results = compare_approaches(text)
print(results)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Shallow NLP approaches are faster but less accurate
- Deep NLP approaches provide better results but require more computational resources
- Choose the appropriate approach based on your specific needs:
  - Use shallow NLP for quick analysis of large text volumes
  - Use deep NLP for tasks requiring high accuracy and understanding
