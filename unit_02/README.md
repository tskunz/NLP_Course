# Unit 2: Levels of Analysis in NLP

## Overview
This unit explores the different levels of analysis in Natural Language Processing, from lower-level lexical analysis to higher-level semantic and discourse analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of how NLP systems process and understand language.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Understand the hierarchy of language analysis levels
- Differentiate between lower and higher levels of analysis
- Apply lexical and syntactic analysis techniques
- Comprehend semantic and discourse analysis methods
- Recognize how different levels interact in NLP implementations
